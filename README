To compile JanEppo, you need net/html, which is currently in development and not
in the main distro.

To get it, 
	go get "code.google.com/p/go.net/html"

Now if you're on my machine, go get will download this, but then complain about
io.ErrNoProgress not existing. If you're like me, you do not feel like solving
this problem the elegant way and getting all kinds of funky bleeding-edge
versions of packages. The alternative is to edit
	[/usr/lib/go]/src/pkg/code.google.com/p/go.net/html/token.go
The part between brackets may be different on your machine, it's GOROOT as
returned by `go env'.  You can search for io.ErrNoProgress and replace it by nil
(or a more sensible value you have thought about). This will work fine for our
purposes.

When you are done, you should be able to build the project; html will be
compiled as part of it and (hopefully) work as intended.
